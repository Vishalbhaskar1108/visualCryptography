# visualCryptography

In this project, I used python to make a program which takes input an image and first breaks it into array of pixels. After that it takes the key input from the user and using the El-Gamal cryptography, it encrypts the image’s each pixel. Then it makes a new image using those pixels which can’t be recognized. The encrypted image is decrypted by using the same key.
